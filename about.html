      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I wrote my first line of code when I was five years old. It was in
        BASIC, using my family's old Amstrad CPC 464. Though I couldn't sweat to
        it, I'm guessing it was something along the lines of:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code
          >10 PRINT "NICK IS GREAT"<br />
          20 GOTO 10
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        As I got little older, and my family bought slightly more modern
        hardware, I started experimenting with making web pages: fan-sites for
        video games I liked, or attempts to write Choose Your Own
        Adventure-style games in pure HTML. Horrifyingly, some of this juvenilia
        is accessible through archive.org. I'll never tell where.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't work with BASIC anymore, but I do work with HTML, alongside CSS
        and Javascript. I also have some experience with SQL, C, Ruby and Dart.
